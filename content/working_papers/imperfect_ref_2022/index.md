**Abstract**: Diagnostic test performance is measured with respect to the true health status determined by a reference test. When the reference is imperfect, sensitivity and specificity are partially identified. I derive their smallest possible joint identification regions in standard test performance studies when reference test performance measures are either known precisely or to be in some bounded set. I formalize existing informally-stated assumptions on dependence between the reference and tests of interest and characterize smaller identification regions when they hold. In my discussion, I provide an inference procedure that yields confidence sets that are uniformly consistent in level over the class of relevant of distributions. I outline two important use-cases for the identification regions: $1)$ bounding prevalence for population screening tests; $2)$ bounding predictive values. Finally, I analyze the performance of the Abbott BinaxNow COVID-19 rapid antigen tests using the framework. I provide estimated identification regions and confidence sets for all currently available COVID-19 rapid antigen tests in the US under the Emergency Use Authorization.
