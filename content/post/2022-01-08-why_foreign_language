Students from Serbia and other ex-Yugoslavian countries rarely choose to apply to U.S. Ph.D. programs in economics and related fields. From my own experience, a major contributor to this phenomenon is the lack of guidance and easily available resources. This may sound strange to many who will read this, but for a moment imagine never having a chance to speak to a single doctoral student or graduate who went on to study at a research university, nor hearing about websites such as URCH or Gradcafe. What if your only source of information were the departmental websites for prospective students, but you have never even heard about this GRE thing? Such is the reality for almost all brilliant students from these countries, many of whom decide not to pursue further academic development being unaware of the possibilities that await them.

I hope to make the access to information more equitable and to help those who do decide to branch out. Thus, the posts below will mostly be written in Serbian. Hopefully, this will make them more appealing to native Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Macedonian/Slovenian speakers, as well.
