Students from Serbia and other ex-Yugoslavian countries rarely choose to apply to leading programs in economics and related fields. From my own experience, a major contributor to this phenomenon is the absence of guidance and a dearth of easily accessible information. This may sound strange to many readers, especially with an abundance guides available online, but the first impression can be deceiving. 

Imagine for a moment that you never had a chance to speak to a single doctoral student at a research university or a graduate, nor to hear about URCH or Gradcafe. Suppose that nearly all your professors obtained their Ph.D. degrees from their current institutions and are unfamiliar with other programs. What if your only sources of information were random undirected Google searches and the odd departmental prospective students page? Would a Ph.D. at a program you have never heard of really be at the top of your list of choices, or would you be more likely to follow what the students before you have done?

Such is the reality for almost all brilliant students from these countries, many of whom decide not to pursue further academic development being unaware of the possibilities that await them. Personally, I was unbelievably lucky with the professors I had the chance to learn from and I have been ushered to consider other programs mainly by people who I met in serendipitous encounters. I am aware that not everybody will have such good fortune.

I hope to make the access to information more equitable and to help those who do decide to branch out by leveraging knowledge of the local universities. Thus, to make the posts in this blog more attractive to the target audience, they will mostly be written in Serbian. Hopefully, this will make them appealing to native Bosnian/Croatian/Montenegrin/Macedonian/Slovenian speakers, as well.
