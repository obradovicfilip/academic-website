Diagnostic tests are almost never perfect and their results may differ from the true health status. Researchers commonly assume that the test results represent the true health status perfectly when measuring average treatment effects (ATE) in randomized controlled trials. When this assumption fails, ATE is not identified. I show how the ATE may be recovered using perfect or approximate knowledge of the test performance. I demonstrate how inference may be performed in both cases and provide an empirical example.
