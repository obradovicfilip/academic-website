# Subtitle was Determining the ATE on health outcomes measured using imperfect diagnostic tests in randomized controlled trials.

# Determining what effect a treatment has on true health status is a typical research goal. Since health status is inherently unobservable, it is routinely replaced  # with a diagnostic test result. Measurement of average treatment effects (ATE) on the health status in randomized controlled trials requires that the status and test # results are equal for every unit of observation. When this assumption fails, ATE is not identified. I show how the ATE may be recovered using perfect or approximate # knowledge of the test performance. I demonstrate how inference may be performed in both cases and provide empirical examples.
