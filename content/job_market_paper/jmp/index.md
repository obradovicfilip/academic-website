title: "Identification of Long-Term Treatment Effects via Temporal Links, Observational, and Experimental Data"
summary: "Filip Obradović. [[Download](https://filipobradovic.com/uploads/Obradovic_JMP.pdf)]
\\
**Abstract**: Recent literature proposes combining short-term experimental and long-term observational data to provide credible alternatives to conventional observational studies for identification of long-term average treatment effects (LTEs). I show that experimental data have an *auxiliary role* in this context. They bring *no identifying power* without additional modeling assumptions. When modeling assumptions are imposed, experimental data serve to *amplify* their identifying power. If the assumptions fail, adding experimental data may only yield results that are farther from the truth. Motivated by this, I introduce two assumptions on *treatment response* that may be defensible based on economic theory or intuition. To utilize them, I develop a novel two-step identification approach that centers on bounding *temporal link functions* -- the relationship between short-term and mean long-term potential outcomes. The approach provides sharp bounds on LTEs for a general class of assumptions, and allows for imperfect experimental compliance -- extending existing results."
