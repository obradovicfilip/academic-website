**Abstract**: Recent literature suggests that combining short-term experimental data with long-term observational data can offer credible alternatives to conventional observational studies for identifying long-term average treatment effects (LTEs). In my work, I demonstrate that experimental data play an *auxiliary role* in this setting. By themselves, they have *no identifying power* unless additional modeling assumptions are introduced. When such assumptions are applied, experimental data enhance the assumptions' identifying power. However, if these assumptions do not hold, incorporating experimental data may lead to estimates that deviate further from the truth. Based on this insight, I propose two assumptions regarding *treatment response* that may be justifiable through economic theory or intuition. To make use of these assumptions, I develop a novel two-step identification method that focuses on bounding *temporal link functions*—the connection between short-term outcomes and average long-term potential outcomes. This approach yields precise bounds on LTEs for a broad set of assumptions and accommodates imperfect experimental compliance, thereby extending existing findings
