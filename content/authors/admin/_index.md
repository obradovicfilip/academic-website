I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at the [Department of Economics at UCLA](https://economics.ucla.edu/). I have received my Ph.D. from [Northwestern University](https://economics.northwestern.edu/). My primary interests lie in econometrics, with an emphasis on identification and inference. In my work, I develop and apply tools to address open problems in economics, health, and medical research.

I also collaborate with the [Northwestern University Transplant Outcomes Research Collaborative (NUTORC)](https://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/sites/nutorc/index.html) on various projects related to liver cirrhosis.

I was born and raised in Serbia.
